x Sharedflows - templates

 maybe create edge-add-resource = add resource of known type, like xml-to-json.xsl
   or a known JS resource ?

 figure out some way to parameterize the JS Steps and XSL steps.
   This is related to the above. And may be the interface to the
   above. 


 Figure out how to get an XML parser in elisp that respects XML
   comments, so my templates don't lose their comments in the cycle of
   deserialization and re-serialization.
